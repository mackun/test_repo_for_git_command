test_repo_for_git_command
=========================

And I locate some bash-compatible shell scripts here  
You could type the following command to get ready to use them  
```bash
source setup.sh
```

## proc

  Search processes with using grep  
  ```bash
  proc foo
  ```

## p

  Echo line(s) in system clipboard  
  ```bash
  p
  ```
