test_repo_for_git_command
-------------------------

And I locate some bash-compatible shell scripts here  
These scripts are all composed of shell functions  
You could only type the following command to get ready to use them  
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### proc

  Search processes with using grep  
  Usage: `proc foo`

### bak

  Rename file with ".bak" suffix  
  Usage: `bak /etc/foo.conf`

### dls

  List up all size of directories and files recursively, sorted by allocated size in reverse order  
  Usage: just type `dls`

### mls

  List up all names of directories and files recursively, sorted by modification time in reverse order  
  Usage: just type `mls`

### fdepl

  Place your new shell function script in ~/.functions directory and get ready to use it  
  Usage: `fdepl your.shell.function`

### unfdepl

  Delete specified file from ~/.functions directory and unfunction it  
  Usage: `unfdepl your.shell.function`

P.S.  
I will never reject any pull requests for my great github experience  
So if you feel free to advise, please spare time for these little scripts for me
