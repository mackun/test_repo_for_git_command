test_repo_for_git_command
=========================

And I locate some bash-compatible shell scripts here  
You could type the following command to get ready to use them  
`source setup.sh`

## proc

  Search processes with using grep  
  Usage: `proc foo`

## p

  Echo line(s) in system clipboard
  Usage: just type `p`
